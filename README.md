# sails generate new 

Generate the files and directory structure for a new Sails app.

```sh
sails new sweet-app
```

> This is a built-in generator exposed by the `sails` command-line interface.  It is installed automatically when you run `npm install -g sails`.  But you _can_ override it, either globally or on a per-app basis, by installing a custom generator.  See [**Extending Sails > Generators**](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/generators) for more information.
